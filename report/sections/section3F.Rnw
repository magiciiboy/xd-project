Figures 3 a-F, are probability distributions of the following data: year of first publication, total number of collaborators, the fraction of collaborators who are cross-disciplinary, PageRank centrality of professors within the network, and mean impact factor of the publication record of professors within the network. The data visualization above supports a conclusion that cross-disciplinary professors (XDF) are more collaborative than biology or computer science specific professors. Figures 3B, C, and D show that cross-disciplinary professors are more collaborative than their single-discipline counterparts. Cross-disciplinary professors have greater total degrees of collaboration, a greater fraction of collaborators who themselves are cross-disciplinary, and higher overall PageRank centrality. Cross-disciplinary professors also outperform biologists and computer scientists in terms of mean publication impact factor. Figure 3A suggests that cross-disciplinary professors published their first paper in genomics on average before biologists and computer scientists.
